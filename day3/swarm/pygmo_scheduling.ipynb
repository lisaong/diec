        "# The Job Shop Problem\n",

        "(Credits: https://developers.google.com/optimization/scheduling/job_shop)\n",
        "\n",
        "One common scheduling problem is the job shop, in which multiple jobs are processed on several machines. Each job consists of a sequence of tasks, which must be performed in a given order, and each task must be processed on a specific machine. For example, the job could be the manufacture of a single consumer item, such as an automobile. The problem is to schedule the tasks on the machines so as to minimize the length of the schedule—the time it takes for all the jobs to be completed.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are several constraints for the job shop problem:\n",
        "\n",
        "* No task for a job can be started until the previous task for that job is completed.\n",
        "* A machine can only work on one task at a time.\n",
        "* A task, once started, must run to completion.\n",
        "\n",
        "## How this applies to Edge Computing\n",
        "Scalable Edge Computing architectures involves multiple compute nodes, where each node may specialise in different functions. For example, an airport security system where video cameras are used to track passenger movement can be envisioned as a pipeline of Edge nodes:\n",
        "- Nodes attached to the video camera doing frame extraction and buffering\n",
        "- Nodes receiving the buffered video frames to perform feature extraction\n",
        "- Nodes running ML algorithms on the extracted video features to get the predicted passenger paths\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that the term \"nodes\" here may refer to physical nodes or logical (functional) nodes within an Edge compute system. The idea is still the same - a pipeline is split into stages (tasks assigned to nodes) so that we can parallelise the pipeline (run multiple jobs at the same time).\n",
        "\n",
        "The Job Shop problem is about how to schedule tasks in parallel to minimise overall latency."
