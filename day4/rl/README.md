## Job Shop Scheduling with OpenAI Gym on Raspberry Pi

![image](../../day3/swarm/job_shop_scheduling.png)

State Space:

We observe the already scheduled tasks, with non-zero start times. Start times of 0 indicate that the task has yet to be scheduled.

Example:
```
{
   'is_scheduled': [0, 0, 1, 0, 5, 0, 10, 1] - tasks 2, 4, 6, 7 already scheduled
                                               tasks 0, 1, 3, 5 not yet scheduled
}
```

Action Space:

The action space consists the last scheduled task_id with its non-zero start time.

Example:
```
# Schedule task 8 at start time 10

{
   'task_id' : 8,
   'start_time' : 10
}
```

Running on Raspberry Pi 3 or 4:
1. Launch the Docker container 
```
cd day4/rl/docker
sh launch_docker.sh
```

2. From the Docker container:
```
# Install the gym environment, then run the script
cd /code/day4/rl/jobshop
python3 jobshop_scheduling_demo.py
```

### Q-Learning Agent

Number of successful episodes for 20000 iterations using Q-Learning:
![history](jobshop/QLearningTDAgent_20000.png)

Each episode begins with a clean slate, where 8 tasks (for 3 jobs) are to be scheduled on 3 machines. The tasks must run on its assigned machine, and in the specified order in the job.

The episode starts with an action. For example, schedule task_id=3 at start_time=8. 

If a task is scheduled without errors (i.e. no overlap, no out of order tasks), the reward is positive (e.g. 600):
```
Action: OrderedDict([('task_id', 0), ('start_time', 4)]), State: {'is_scheduled': [4, 0, 0, 0, 7, 16, 0, 0]}, Reward: 100, Done: False, Info: {'makespan': 16}
Job-view:
0: Job: 0, Machine: 0, Start: 4, End: 7
1: Job: 0, Machine: 1, Start: 0, End: -1
2: Job: 0, Machine: 2, Start: 0, End: -1
3: Job: 1, Machine: 0, Start: 0, End: -1
4: Job: 1, Machine: 2, Start: 7, End: 8
5: Job: 1, Machine: 1, Start: 16, End: 20
6: Job: 2, Machine: 1, Start: 0, End: -1
7: Job: 2, Machine: 2, Start: 0, End: -1

|----|----|----|----
                5555

Machine 2:
|----|--
       4
```

When a task is scheduled with errors (e.g. machine overlap, or out-of-sequence tasks), the reward is negative.
In order for the agent to experience as much as possible, the episode continues on until all tasks are scheduled:
```
Action: OrderedDict([('task_id', 6), ('start_time', 13)]), State: {'is_scheduled': [4, 19, 0, 14, 7, 16, 13, 0]}, Reward: -100, Done: False, Info: {'makespan': 17, 'errors': 'Machine Overlap'}
Job-view:
0: Job: 0, Machine: 0, Start: 4, End: 7

3: Job: 1, Machine: 0, Start: 14, End: 16
4: Job: 1, Machine: 2, Start: 7, End: 8
5: Job: 1, Machine: 1, Start: 16, End: 20
6: Job: 2, Machine: 1, Start: 13, End: 17
7: Job: 2, Machine: 2, Start: 0, End: -1

                   11

Machine 2:
|----|--
       4

```

When all episodes are complete, the best schedule based on Q-values stored in the agent will be printed. Note that this schedule can still result in errors when the agent has not learnt an optimum policy (aka the objective of reinforcement learning!)

```
Passing rate: 8.86%

Temporal Differencing Q-Learning for single-agent seems too naive to learn the optimum policy quickly, resulting in best schedule with errors. It is still better than the baseline (RandomAgent), which has 0% passing rate.

### Deep Q-Learning Agent

The Deep Q-learning configuration trains one Deep Neural Network per task to predict the Q-values given the state.

Input: 1 observation of the current schedule, shape = (number_of_tasks,)
Output: Q-values, shape = (max_schedule_length, 1)

```
for i in range(n_models):
   model = Sequential([
         Dense(input_size*4, input_dim=input_size, activation='relu'),
         Dense(input_size*4, activation='relu'),
         Dense(output_size, activation='linear')
   ])

   # start with a slow learning rate as we are fitting in smaller
   # batches (which will be noiser)
   model.compile(loss='mse', optimizer=Adam(lr=1e-3), metrics=['mae'])
   self.models.append(model)
```

Used Adam with a slow learning rate to reduce noise. 
Replay memory is used to update the network every minibatch to improve convergence.

Epsilon decay of 0.995 is applied to encourage early exploration, eventually decaying towards exploitation.

Training output:
```
Action: OrderedDict([('task_id', 6), ('start_time', 2)]), State: {'is_scheduled': [16, 0, 14, 0, 0, 10, 2, 3]}, Reward: -100, Done: False, Info: {'makespan': 17, 'errors': 'Duplicate Scheduling'}
